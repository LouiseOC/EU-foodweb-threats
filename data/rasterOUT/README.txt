These tif files contain information on the spatial vulnerability of food webs across Europe to different threats. 
- EU_[spp-or-links]_thr_by_[threat].tif are the raster files containing the proportion of species (spp), or interactions (links) to each threat type. 
- multiply_[threat].tif are the raster files containing the hotspots of food web vulnerability per threat. Hotspots are defined as areas with both many species and many interactions, that are vulnerable to each threat type.
